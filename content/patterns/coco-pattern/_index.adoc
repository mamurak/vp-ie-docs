= About coco-pattern

Confidential computing is a technology for securing data in use. It uses a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment[Trusted Execution Environment] provided within the hardware of the processor to prevent access from others who have access to the system.
https://confidentialcontainers.org/[Confidential containers] is a project to standardize the consumption of confidential computing by making the security boundary for confidential computing to be a Kubernetes pod. https://katacontainers.io/[Kata containers] is used to establish the boundary via a shim VM.

A core goal of confidential computing is to use this technology to isolate the workload from both Kubernetes and hypervisor administrators.

This pattern uses https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_sandboxed_containers/1.7/html/user_guide/deploying-on-azure#deploying-cc_azure-cc[Red Hat OpenShift sandbox containers] to deploy and configure confidential containers on Microsoft Azure.

It deploys three copies of 'Hello OpenShift' to demonstrate some of the security boundaries that enforced with confidential containers.

== Requirements

- An an azure account with the link:./coco-pattern-azure-requirements/[required access rights]
- An OpenShift cluster, within the Azure environment updated beyond 4.16.10


== Security considerations

**This pattern is a demonstration only and contains configuration that is not best practice**

- The default configuration deploys everything in a single cluster for testing purposes. The https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-rats-architecture-22.html[RATS] architecture mandates that the Key Broker Service (e.g. https://github.com/confidential-containers/trustee[Trustee]) is in a trusted security zone.
- The https://github.com/confidential-containers/trustee/tree/main/attestation-service[Attestation Service] has wide open security policies.

== Future work

* Deploying the environment the 'Trusted' environment including the KBS on a separate cluster to the secured workloads
* Deploying to alternative environments supporting confidential computing including bare metal x86 clusters; IBM Cloud; IBM Z
* Finishing the sample AI application

== Architecture

Confidential Containers typically has two environments. A trusted zone, and an untrusted zone. In these zones, Trustee, and the sandbox container operator are deployed, respectively.

** For demonstration purposes the pattern currently is converged on one cluster**
