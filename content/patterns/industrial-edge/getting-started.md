# Deploying the Industrial Edge Pattern

# Prerequisites

1. An OpenShift cluster (Go to [the OpenShift
   console](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create)). Cluster must have a
   dynamic StorageClass to provision PersistentVolumes. See also [sizing your
   cluster](../../industrial-edge/cluster-sizing).
1. (Optional) A second OpenShift cluster for edge/factory

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat
OpenShift cluster. It is desirable to have a cluster for deploying the data
center assets and a separate cluster(s) for the factory assets.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using [Red Hat's cloud
service](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create).

## Prerequisites

For installation tooling dependencies, see [Patterns quick start](/learn/quickstart)

The Industrial Edge pattern installs an in-cluster gitea instance by default. This 
means that there is no need to fork the pattern's git repository and that ArgoCD will point
directly at the in-cluster git repository. Changes should be done there and not on github.
See this [post](https://validatedpatterns.io/blog/2024-07-12-in-cluster-git/) for more information.

# How to deploy

1. Clone the [industrial-edge](https://github.com/validatedpatterns/industrial-edge) repository on GitHub.

1. On your laptop or bastion host login to your cluster by using the `oc login` command or by exporting the `KUBECONFIG` file.

   ```sh
   oc login
   ```

   or

   ```sh
   export KUBECONFIG=~/my-ocp-cluster/auth/kubeconfig
   ```

1. Deploy the industrial edge pattern:

   ```sh
   cd <path-to-cloned-github-repository>
   ./pattern.sh make install
   ```
 The `make install` target deploys the Validated Patterns Operator, all the resources that are defined in the `values-datacenter.yaml`

# Validating the Environment

1. Verify that the following Operators are installed on the HUB cluster:

   ```text
   $ oc get operators.operators.coreos.com -A
   NAME                                                  AGE

   odf-operator.openshift-storage                        3h8m
   odf-prometheus-operator.openshift-storage             3h7m
   openshift-gitops-operator.openshift-operators         3h11m

   patterns-operator.openshift-operators                 3h12m

   rook-ceph-operator.openshift-storage                  3h7m
   ```

   **Note: The list above was taken on OpenShift 4.16. It might change slightly depending on the OpenShift version being used (e.g. odf has less operator components on OpenShift 4.15 and earlier)**

1. Access the ArgoCD environment

   You can find the ArgoCD application links listed under the nine box **Red
   Hat applications** in the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

   ![ArgoCD Links](/images/industrial-edge/nine-box.png)

   The most important ArgoCD instance to examine at this point is the
   `Datacenter ArgoCD`. This is where all the applications for the datacenter,
   including the test environment, can be tracked.

1. Check that all applications are synchronised. It should look like the following:

   ![ArgoCD Apps](/images/industrial-edge/datacenter-argocd-apps.png)

## Next Steps

Once the data center has been setup correctly and confirmed to be working, you can:

1. Add a dedicated cluster to the main datacenter hub cluster.

   By default the `factory` applications defined in the `values-factory.yaml` file
   are deployed on all clusters imported into ACM and that have the label
   `clusterGroup=factory`

   For instructions on how to prepare and import a factory cluster please read the
   section [importing a cluster](/learn/importing-a-cluster). Use
   `clusterGroup=factory` as the label.

2. Once the data center and the factory have been deployed you will want to
   check out and test the Industrial Edge 2.0 demo code. You can find that
   [here](../application/). The argo applications on the factory cluster will look
   like the following:
