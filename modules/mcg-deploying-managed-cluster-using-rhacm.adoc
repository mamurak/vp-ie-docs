= Deploying a managed cluster by using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management

.Prerequistes

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console].
 ** Select *Services* -> *Containers* -> *Create cluster*.

* Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) web console to join the managed cluster to the management hub
+
[NOTE]
====
After RHACM is installed, a message regarding a *Web console update is available* might be displayed. Follow the instructions and click the *Refresh web console* link.
====

.Procedure

. In the left navigation panel of web console, click *local-cluster*. Select *All Clusters*. The RHACM web console is displayed with *Cluster** on the left navigation panel.
. On the *Managed clusters* tab, click *Import cluster*.
. On the *Import an existing cluster* page, enter the cluster name and choose *KUBECONFIG* as the "import mode". Add the tag `clusterGroup=group-one`. Click *Import*.

Now that RHACM is no longer deploying the managed cluster applications everywhere, you must indicate that the new cluster has the managed cluster role.
