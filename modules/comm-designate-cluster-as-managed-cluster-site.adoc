[id="designate-cluster-as-a-managed-cluster-site"]
= Designate the new cluster as a managed cluster site

If you use the command line tools such as `clusteradm` or `cm-cli`, you must explicitly indicate that the imported cluster is part of a specific `clusterGroup`. Some examples of `clusterGroup` are `factory`, `devel`, or `prod`.

To tag the cluster as `clusterGroup=<managed-cluster-group>`, complete the following steps.

.Procedure

. To list all managed clusters, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io
----
+
This will display a list of managed clusters registered in ACM, including their names and statuses.

. Once you identify the target cluster for example `YOURCLUSTER`, label it with the desired key-value pair to associate it with a group or category. To apply the label, run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io/YOURCLUSTER site=managed-cluster
----

.Verification

. Confirm that the label was applied by running the following command: 
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io/YOURCLUSTER --show-labels
----
+
This will display the labels associated with the cluster, verifying that the new label has been successfully added..

. Optional: If youâ€™re grouping clusters under a clusterGroup for example `factory`, `devel`, or `prod`, add the clusterGroup label also by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label managedcluster.cluster.open-cluster-management.io/YOURCLUSTER clusterGroup=<group-name>
----
+
Replace `<group-name>` with the appropriate value, such as `factory`.
